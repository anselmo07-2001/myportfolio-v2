# 🧑‍💻 My Redesigned Portfolio

I recently gave my portfolio a complete redesign using **React.js** and **Material UI**.  
It has a cleaner look, smoother animations, and better responsiveness across devices.  

You can check it out here 👉 [https::](https://portfolio.riveraanselmo.com/)

This showcases my **tech skills**, the **projects I’ve built**, and a short **about me** section — plus a **contact form** if you want to get in touch or collaborate.

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- React.js  
- Material UI  
- EmailJS (for sending messages)  
- Vite *(for fast builds, if used)*
